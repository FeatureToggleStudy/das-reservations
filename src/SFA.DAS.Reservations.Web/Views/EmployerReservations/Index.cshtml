You can secure funding no more than 6 months in advance of the date the apprentice starts their off-the-job training.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Before you start you will need:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>an estimate of which month the apprentice will start their apprenticeship training, which can be flexible up to 3 months</li>
                <li>an idea of the <a href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/" target="_blank" class="govuk-link">apprenticeship training</a> the apprentice will take (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">You will be securing funding for 1 apprentice at a time. Repeat the process for more apprentices.</p>
