<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>an estimate of which month the apprentice will start their apprenticeship training, which can be flexible up to 3 months</li>
    <li>an idea of the <a href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/" target="_blank">apprenticeship training</a> the apprentice will take (optional)</li>
